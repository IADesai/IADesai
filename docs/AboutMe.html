        A first-class honours chemical engineering graduate from University
        College London, I have complemented my studies with a minor in computer
        science, resulting in an intriguing fusion of unique insights and
        skills. I attribute my knowledge base to intensive coursework, exciting
        programming projects, and endurance during challenging training courses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coding has always been my creative outlet, providing me the ability to
        transform ideas into functional digital artwork. Since the age of eight,
        when I discovered the pleasure of coding via Scratch, I have never
        ceased learning and exploring. As my academic journey expanded, I
        encompassed pure sciences and eventually chemical engineering, the
        latter being my primary degree. Notwithstanding, my passion for
        programming persisted, leading me to an additional minor in computer
        science.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides this formal academic and technical training, the exposure from
        my employment history contributes significantly to my broadened
        understanding. As a Managing Director of H&C Retailing LTD, I learned to
        handle real-world technical and non-technical challenges. I also
        accomplished my role as an SIA Licensed Door Supervisor at Centre Circle
        Events Management and as a part-time Barista at several coffee shops.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the role that truly allowed me to implement my IT knowledge in
        the real world was my stint as a Trainee Data Engineer at Sigma Labs. I
        undertook various programming projects, handling complex issues, and
        learning to work in a team-centric environment. This foundational
        experience has allowed me to develop not just technically, but also
        refine my collaborative skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of my tech stack, Python has remained my mainstay, providing me
        with over 700 hours of experience, I have recently forayed into web
        development through personal and volunteer projects. I have delved into
        HTML and CSS, and have begun my journey with JavaScript. My data
        engineering training gave me an industry standard level understanding of
        AWS, Terraform, PostgreSQL, and many more.
